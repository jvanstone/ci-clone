								<p>Viral vector-based vaccines use a harmless virus, such as an adenovirus, as a delivery system. This “vector” virus is not the virus that causes COVID-19. Adenoviruses are among the viruses that can cause the common cold. There are many different types of adenoviruses, and many have been used as delivery systems for other vector-based vaccines for decades.</p>
								<p>When a person is given the vaccine, the vector virus contained within the vaccine produces the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This protein is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. This protein will not make you sick. It does its job and goes away.</p>
								<p>Through this process, the body is able to build a strong immune response against the spike protein without exposing you to the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>

							<div class="card-body">
								<p>In general, the side effects observed during the clinical trials are similar to what you might have with other vaccines.</p>
								<p>The side effects that followed vaccine administration in clinical trials were mild or moderate. They included pain at the site of injection, body chills, feeling tired and feeling feverish.</p>
								<p>These are common side effects of vaccines and do not pose a risk to health.</p>
								<p>As with all vaccines, there’s a chance that there will be a serious side effect, but these are rare. Serious side effect might be something like an allergic reaction. Speak with your health professional about any serious allergies or other health conditions you may have before you receive this vaccine.</p>
								<p>Health Canada has conducted a rigorous scientific review of the available medical evidence to assess the safety of the the Janseen vaccine. No major safety concerns have been identified in the data reviewed. </p>

								<p>As for all medicines, Health Canada will continue to monitor the safety of the the Janseen vaccine in Canada closely. Along with the Public Health Agency of Canada and working in close collaboration with the provinces and territories and the manufacturer, to monitor for any adverse events that may develop after immunization.</p>
								<p>Once the product is on the market, the manufacturer (Janssen Inc.) is legally required to submit reports of adverse events and other safety information to Health Canada.</p>
								<p>The manufacturer is planning to follow clinical trial participants for at least 2 years after the second dose of the vaccine is given. It must communicate any safety concerns to Health Canada.</p>
								<p>To ensure that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risks, may also impose terms and conditions at any time. For example, can require the manufacturer to take further risk mitigation measures. Can also ask the manufacturer to submit additional safety information.</p>
								<p>Health Canada will continue to review all the available safety data as it becomes available. Take appropriate action, if required, to protect the health and safety of Canadians.</p>
